\textbf{Definition:\;} Eine auf dem Intervall $I$ differenzierbare Funktion $F$ ist eine Stammfunktion der Funktion $f : I \to \real$, wnn $F'(x)= f(x)$ für alle $x \in I$. \par \abstand
Fakt 1: Sind $F_1$ und $F_2$ Stammfunktionen von $f$, dann gilt $F_1(x) = F_2(x) + c$ für alle $x \in I$ und ein $c \in \real$ (aus dem Mitterlwertsatz). \par \abstand

\textbf{Definition:\;} Die Menge aller Stammfunktionen von $f$ wird das unbestimmte Integral von $f$ genannt und mit $\int f(x) dx = F(x) + c$ bezeichnet.
